# Note Taker Starter Code# week-11-challenge

## Description

The objective of this unit was to create a server-side API using the Express.js framework that uses routing to handle server-side responses to client-side URL requests. The application highlights use of three of the most commonly used HTTP methods, including POST, GET, and DELETE to create a working front-end and back-end application.

In terms of app functionality, it is built to allow users to input and save simple notes or to-do list items, including a title and text for each, and then delete them as necessary.

## User Story
```md
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Criteria

```md
    GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
